# Tensorflow-Pikachu
Example project using Tensorflow Lite. Built from:  
  

- github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow  
- github.com/juandes/pikachu-detection  
  
  
  
## How to compile the project?  
  
Add the directory */android* to Android-Studio and it should be ready to run.  
Dependencies were updated 20/Jan/2019  
  
If you want to add your own tflite model and labels, do so in /android/assets and replace it in /android/java/DetectorActivity.  
  
Feel free to add questions, send me a message.    
  
  
P.S. :By no means I am an expert in TFLite, I'm just re-using the tensorflow default project and pikachu model.
